\chapter*{Abstract}

This template is based on Qinquan's Doctor/Master thesis template (LaTeXBook2.02)
and similar thesis templates (e.g. Tsinghua's Doctor/Master thesis template).
It has been tested under the full version of CTeX2.4.2 (with miktex2.4) or later.


Generally, the abstract and the key words should be consistent
with the Chinese version.
